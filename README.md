# Iris-flower-classification
This project offers a comprehensive method for classifying Iris flowers utilizing machine learning. It begins by examining the Iris dataset with descriptive statistics and visualizations. Various classification algorithms are subsequently employed to forecast the flower species. Performance evaluation of each model aids in gauging their efficacy.

## Repository Structure

**Data Analysis and Visualization:**

    * The dataset is loaded and basic statistics are computed.
    * Several visualizations are created to understand the distribution and relationship of the features within the dataset.
    * Scatter plots, line plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps are used to explore the data.
    * Machine Learning Models:

**Multiple models are trained and evaluated to classify the species of Iris flowers.
Models used include:**

    * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    * Logistic Regression
    * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    * Decision Tree
    * Dependencies

## Dependencies

**The following Python libraries are required to run the code:**

    * pandas
    * numpy
    * matplotlib
    * seaborn
    * scikit-learn
    
**You can install the dependencies using the following command:**

    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
